"""On-chain reward tracker — sums ERC-20 Transfer events into the operator
wallet since 00:00 UTC today.

The agent's log-derived `rewards_today_total` only captures rewards the Capsule
log emits a `FOR balance before/after reward` pair for, which structurally
undercounts (observer rewards, periodic distributions land on-chain but never in
the log). This tracker is the authoritative number for the dashboard's
"FOR earned today" headline.

Design:
- Singleton `tracker` instance. Refresh is idempotent + cached (30s TTL,
  matching `_cached_balance`).
- First call after a fresh deploy: find the block whose timestamp >= today's
  UTC midnight via binary search (~20 RPC calls). Then scan from there to
  `latest` in chunks of <=1000 blocks via `get_transfer_events`.
- Subsequent calls: scan from `last_scanned_block + 1` to `latest` (usually
  <30 blocks → 1 RPC call).
- UTC day rollover: clear today_transfers, re-find midnight block on next
  refresh.

        sourcing from `self.today_transfers` by interval-overlap match.

        Why: recent Capsule versions stopped logging `Resolution of ...
        receipt hash 0x...` so the agent's parser can't pair tx hashes.
        Chain-side matching is format-independent and uses the authoritative
        Monad receipt.

        Two-pass strategy (v10.1):
          1. STRICT pass with `pad_seconds` (default 300 s) — for each
             unmatched participation, take the closest unused transfer
             whose ts falls inside `[start_ts - pad, completed_ts + pad]`.
             Greedy in completed-ts order so earlier rounds claim first.
          2. RELAXED pass with `pad_seconds * 6` (default 30 min) — for
             rounds still unmatched after pass 1. Same `used` set so a
             pass-1 winner can't be re-claimed.
          Pass 2 catches:
             - deferred-resolution rounds (the Capsule logs
               `Waiting for N milliseconds before resolving intent`,
               where N has been observed >5 min in the wild)
             - rounds whose strict-window neighbor stole the tx
        Risk acknowledged: pass 2 can mis-attribute. Since observer rounds
        are already skipped (`participated: False`) and `used` prevents
        stealing pass-1 winners, the worst case is "tx_hash points at a
        nearby wallet credit rather than this exact round" — the operator
        can verify on monadscan; showing `—` for half their participations
        is worse UX.

        Returns a NEW list (doesn't mutate input). Rounds with a non-null
        tx_hash already populated by the agent are left untouched.

        Pre-conditions: `today_date` is a "YYYY-MM-DD" string used to convert
