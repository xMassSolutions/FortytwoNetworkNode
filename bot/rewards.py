"""On-chain reward tracker — sums ERC-20 Transfer events into the operator
wallet since 00:00 UTC today.

The agent's log-derived `rewards_today_total` only captures rewards the Capsule
log emits a `FOR balance before/after reward` pair for, which structurally
undercounts (observer rewards, periodic distributions land on-chain but never in
the log). This tracker is the authoritative number for the dashboard's
"FOR earned today" headline.

Design:
- Singleton `tracker` instance. Refresh is idempotent + cached (30s TTL,
  matching `_cached_balance`).
- First call after a fresh deploy: find the block whose timestamp >= today's
  UTC midnight via binary search (~20 RPC calls). Then scan from there to
  `latest` in chunks of <=1000 blocks via `get_transfer_events`.
- Subsequent calls: scan from `last_scanned_block + 1` to `latest` (usually
  <30 blocks → 1 RPC call).
- UTC day rollover: clear today_transfers, re-find midnight block on next
  refresh.
